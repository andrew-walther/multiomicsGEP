# Round 2 progress and review handoff

Authority: `docs/plans/Codex_Handoff_Round2_10_16_26.md`.
Attempt history: `docs/plans/Round2_attempts_log.md`.
Current cumulative branch: `round2/supervised`. No pushes or merges into the base
or main branches are authorized. The benchmark is unchanged and no replacement
configuration has been proposed or approved.

## Task 0 — integrate Round 1 (complete)

Benchmark manifest before work: ten files passed. Benchmark tag resolves to
`a352f17ca9cff523caa80756aa2af085e62551e1`.

- `2131c30`: merge protected-pruning branch; 553 tests passed, zero failed.
- `eb6b290`: merge simulation comparators; 554 passed, zero failed.
- `f2c2a85`: merge multimodal comparators; 556 passed, zero failed.
- `bf3e050`: merge robustness and initialize Round 2 records; 559 passed, zero failed.
- `b9a3952`: final DeSurv audit merge; 559 passed, zero failed.

Documentation conflicts preserve every dated entry. Round 1's blocked assessments,
conditional comparator denominators, collapsed multimodal fit and D's nonzero
process exit remain explicit. No new scientific fit has started.

## Task 1 — positive-SD protection and rank panel (pre-registered)

The approved SD>0 protection correction is implemented. Dead-program and
credible-program tests pass; default/off fits match the base branch bit for bit.
Full suite before the attempt: **563 passed, 0 failed**.
The corrected 800-cell panel and its adoption rule are committed before running;
see Task 1 attempt 1 in the attempt history. Per-cell errors, warnings and
intermediate pruning caps are retained. No empirical adoption result yet.

## Tasks 2–6

Pending Task 1 assessment. The handoff's corrected positive-SD protection rule
and each model's own convergence rule control Task 1. No criteria or defaults
have been changed. Task 2 selection and diagnosis will use training data only.
